If any of these are no longer valid (or no longer the method that would be chosen by dispatch), then some compiled code in this package image must be invalidated and recompiled.\n\nedges: A lookup table of external_targets dependencies: [mi1, indxs1, mi2, indxs2...] means that mi1 (cached in this pkgimage) depends on external_targets[idxs1]; mi2 depends on external_targets[idxs2], and so on.\n\nfilesize: The total size of the cache file.\n\ncachesizes: Sizes of the individual sections.

Each form of auxillary data gets stored in distinct sections.\n\nsysdata: Size of the image.
